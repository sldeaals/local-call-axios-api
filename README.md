# local-call-axios-api
Local api call for reading a JSON file

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

## TASK
For this task, you will be implementing a page that displays programming jobs. You can use this page inspiration:
https://weworkremotely.com/categories/remote-front-end-programming-jobs#job-listings

### STEPS
Here are the steps you will need to follow:
1. Create a single page application in ReactJS.
2. Inside the application, you will need to create a json file containing some Dummy data.Name the file jobs.json.
3. Once that is finished, create a service that retrieves the information from the file at point #2. The HTTP method should be GET.
4. Display the data in your page. Note that you should only focus on the jobs list, nothing else. Company photos need not to be displayed.
5. Using Bootstrap, another framework of your choice, or custom CSS that you write from scratch, style the page to mimic the style from the example above.
6. Make sure the solution is also responsive and adaptive, i.e. elements change size and position based on screen resolution so that it looks good on any device and on any resolution.

THINGS TO CONSIDER
- The JSON file is there to mimic a server call, so please remember to read the info as you would invoke an API/server;
- You can search for any questions you have regarding the documentation of the frameworks you decide to use;
- You can create as many components as you like;
- You can use any extra frameworks you like (i.e. fontawesome, bootstrap, tailwind, etc.);
- How you organize and document your code is important, so please pay attention to leave it in an orderly manner;
